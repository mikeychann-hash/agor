# Agor: A Multiplayer-ready, Spatial Layer for Agentic Coding

Once in a while the stars line up and something that felt "obvious but not quite here yet" suddenly clicks. Agents got scary good, we all started plate‑spinning across terminal chats, and the handoffs/visibility/env stuff just didn’t keep up. Agor is my answer to that moment: a multiplayer, spatial layer for agent orchestration.

Not another chat window — an actual canvas where sessions live, fork, spawn, and move; where zones trigger real workflows; where worktrees run their own envs without port roulette. Think Figma energy, but for code and agents. Massive props to the folks making these models and SDKs — the superpower is real. Agor is the glue that lets teams (and swarms) actually use it together.

## Why this matters

Agents are a superpower. Everything around them can still be a buzzkill: linear chats, clumsy handoffs, zero visibility, envs that work “on my machine” and nowhere else. We’ve all juggled a dozen tabs and terminal panes.

Agor flips that into a multiplayer canvas. See all the work at once. Fork without trashing context. Spawn clean subsessions for focused tasks. Share running environments without port roulette. Less juggling; more shipping.

## What you can do

- Spatial canvas: Arrange sessions on a 2D board. Presence shows who’s where. Your brain remembers places better than scrollback.
- Session trees: Fork to parallelize, spawn to delegate. Fresh, clean context when you need it; shared context when you don’t.
- Worktrees + envs: Each worktree gets its own dev server and ports. Parallel features without stepping on toes.
- Zone triggers: Drag a card into “Needs Tests” or “Ready for Review” and a templated prompt fires with live board/worktree/session context.
- SDK‑first orchestration: Coordinate Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini via SDKs (MCP baked in). No brittle CLI scraping.

For a quick peek, see the project [README](https://github.com/mistercrunch/agor#readme) for GIFs and screencaps (zones, session trees, envs).

## Quick start

Fastest: Codespaces (great for sharing with a team)

[Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/mistercrunch/agor?quickstart=1&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fplayground%2Fdevcontainer.json)

Or run locally with Docker

```bash
docker compose up
# Visit http://localhost:5173 → Login: admin@agor.live / admin
```

More details: [Getting Started](/guide/getting-started), [Docker Guide](/guide/docker), [Development Guide](/guide/development)

## How Agor is different

Not another chat or CLI wrapper. Agor is the layer above your tools that makes them work together.

- Multiplayer‑first: presence, comments, real‑time updates
- Spatial by design: location‑as‑memory beats endless scrollback
- Agent‑native: SDK‑first with session‑scoped MCP (no brittle CLI parsing)

## Who it’s for

- Solo builders plate‑spinning across Claude Code/Codex/Gemini
- Teams that want async handoffs, shared running envs, and live visibility

## Roadmap highlights

- Close the gap with native CLIs via SDKs
- Bring‑your‑own IDE (connect VSCode/Cursor to Agor‑managed worktrees)
- Automated reports and a composable context system
